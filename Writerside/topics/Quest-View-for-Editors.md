# Quest View, for Editors

## Creating and Editing the Overview

The overview editor, aka the quest description editor, has buttons for applying styling or color to selected text.

Heracles also supports basic [_Markdown_-like](Markdown-Heracles-Style.md) syntax for easy formatting.

## Adding, Changing, and Deleting Tasks or Rewards

Hovering over a task or reward, in the respective `Tasks` or `Rewards` tab, will reveal to the right two buttons: a pencil icon button to edit the task or reward, and a trashcan button to delete it.

A large `âž•` button, for adding a new task or reward, can be found at the bottom of the `Tasks` and `Rewards` tabs.
