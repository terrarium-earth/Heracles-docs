# Quest View, for Players

## Overview

There are three major components to a quest: an **Overview**, **Tasks**, and **Rewards**.
Quests are not strictly required to have all three, but usually will.

Here is what a typical quest might look like, once you have clicked on its icon in the Group View to open it.

## Tasks
At the top of this tab is a summary of task completion progress for this task. This information is also presented near bottom left of the screen, in all tabs.

Tasks will be grouped by their state (`In Progress` or `Completed`), and also display their internal progress, be it one step or many.

## Rewards

In the rewards tab, once all tasks have been completed, you may click the button with a bag icon on the right side of a reward to claim it.
Alternatively, there is a `Claim Rewards` button at bottom left of the screen to claim all rewards in this quest.
