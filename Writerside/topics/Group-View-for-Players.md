# Group View, for Players

This is Heracles' main screen, the Group View. Some example quests are shown, with some progress already made—indicated by the colored backgrounds of the quests with the log and map icons.

## Quest States

Different textures for quest icon backgrounds are used to indicate progress state. In the default theme these are:

- darker: quest is locked / has un-completed dependencies.
- lighter: quest in un-locked / in-progress
- orange: tasks achieved, reward(s) un-claimed.
- green: quest is completed and reward(s) claimed.

## Quest Groups

Groups of quests are listed in the column on the left. To view a group just click on its name.

> The Edit Mode button—the pencil icon just left of the close button (X) top right—will only show when cheats are enabled, or you are in Creative mode, or on servers for players with OP access.
