# Group View, for Editors

### Buttons
When Edit Mode is active, more buttons are displayed:

From left to right, these buttons are:

- `New Group`: for adding groups.
- `Select` tool: for selecting quests

- `Import`: for importing quest data
- `Edit Mode`: for entering or leaving Edit Mode
- `Exit`: for exiting Heracles

Not shown:
- `Delete Group`: when hovering a group name, an 'x' appears, for deleting that group

### Quest Settings
When a quest is selected in Edit Mode, a panel of options for that quest appears on the right side:

Underneath the `Title`, `Position`, and `Subtitle` boxes, are five "Action" buttons.

From left to right these buttons are:
- `Change Icon`
- `Change Icon Background`
- `Change Dependencies`
- `Delete`
- `Edit Quest Settings`

##### Options for `Hide Until`
The `Edit Quest Settings` action button brings up a pop-up box with five settings:

The options for `Hidden Until` may warrant explanation; the rest are fairly self-explanatory

`Hidden Until` options are:
- `Locked`: Always display this quest (don't hide it)
- `In Progess`: Hide until dependencies are completed
- `Completed`: Hide until this quest _itself_ is completed
- `Parents Visible`: Hide this quest until it's dependencies are visible
